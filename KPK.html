            Ranked 5th by The Guardian as one of the top attractions of Pakistan. This is one is a treat, one that would compel you to pat your eyes twice to acknowledge reality or that it isn't a dream. 
            Words can hardly be just to this place's attraction. The sea green, clear as crystal, freezing water surface amid gigantic glaciers is one part of it. 
            A classic fable goes about this area of a prince and a fairy queen still residing and dancing above water surface every month on 14th of lunar calendar. 
            Should you get along with a local inhabitant by chance, they would certainly run you through this tale.

            You must have heard about this one a lot. It is more about seeing this one rather, anyway. It is simply said that this area is a maze of scenic beauty. It's a host of hiking and great weather 
            that is a lot cooler because of its magnificent altitude. Nathiagali is located midway and an hourâ€™s drive away from Abbottabad and Murree; double the time if you're driving from Islamabad. Head out during May, June, July, and August,
             it would be best suited, since during these months the temperature is tolerable for a visitor generally in KPK. However, when you hear about fog here, take your steps back because visibility is reduced to a few feet only. Nothing like your hometown's fog. 
            Top attractions Pakistan can be scattered in hazards.
