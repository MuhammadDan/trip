            Mohenjo Daro was an ancient city located in the Sindh province of modern-day Pakistan. It is believed to have been founded around 2500 BCE and flourished during the Indus Valley Civilization.Mohenjo Daro was an
            important trade center and is known for its well-planned streets, elaborate drainage systems, and advanced brick-making technology. The city was also home to a number of large public buildings, including a Great Bath,
            a large assembly hall, and several granaries.The Indus Valley Civilization, of which Mohenjo Daro was a part, is notable for its advanced level of urbanization, as well as its use of standardized weights and measures,
            which suggest a sophisticated system of trade and governance.Mohenjo Daro is thought to have been abandoned around 1900 BCE, although the exact reason for its decline is not known. Some theories suggest that the city may 
            have been abandoned due to a change in trade routes, while others suggest that it may have been abandoned due to environmental factors, such as a change in the course of the Indus River.Mohenjo Daro was rediscovered in the 
            1920s by a team of archaeologists led by John Marshall, and excavations of the site have continued to the present day. 
            The city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a popular tourist attraction in Pakistan.
